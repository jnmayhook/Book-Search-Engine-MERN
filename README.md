# Book-Search-Engine-MERN

## Description
Two things drive most modern websites: data and user demands, and with that, the ability to personalize user data is the cornerstone of real-world web development today. And as user demands evolve, applications need to be more performant.

This application features Google Booksâ€™ API search engine and was built with a RESTful API before it was refactored into a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was also created using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It has signup and login forms, allowing users to save and delete book searches to the back end when logged in.
